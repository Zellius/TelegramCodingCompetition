Android API 16+, Java 1.8, no Google support libraries

### Warning
I didn't have time to finish the project. So it doesn't have a state-of-the-art code style. But maybe I'll finish it later.

### Description

The goal is to develop software for showing simple charts based on input data we provide. You can use either JavaScript, Android Java or iOS Swift. 

Note: you may not use specialized charting libraries. All the code you submit must be written by you from scratch.

The criteria weâ€™ll be using to define the winner are speed, efficiency and the size of the app.

The app should show 4 charts on one screen.
